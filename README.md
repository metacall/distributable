### What are distributables? 

A distributable, in software terms, refers to a package of compiled code that can be distributed and installed on various platforms or operating systems. This package often includes all the necessary files and dependencies needed for the software to run, such as executable files, libraries, configuration files, and sometimes documentation.

### MetaCall Distributable

In a project like MetaCall, which supports multiple operating systems, there are typically separate distributable packages for each platform. These packages ensure users on different systems can install and run MetaCall effortlessly. MetaCall distributables are self-contained and portable, making it easy to move and use MetaCall across various environments without requiring additional setup.
